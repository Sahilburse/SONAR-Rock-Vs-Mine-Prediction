# Sonar Rock vs Mine Prediction

## Project Description
This project is a machine learning model designed to classify sonar signals as either rocks or mines. It helps in identifying underwater mines using sonar data, which can be crucial for naval operations and safety.

## Role
- Designed and implemented the machine learning model
- Performed data preprocessing and feature extraction
- Applied classification algorithms for prediction

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Libraries: NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib

## Features
- Preprocess sonar signal data for accurate predictions
- Classifies objects as rocks or mines using ML algorithms
- Provides a reliable prediction pipeline for sonar signal analysis

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   ```
2. Install required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the main Python file:
   ```bash
   python sonar_classification.py
   ```

## Dataset
